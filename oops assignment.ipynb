    "#(2) What is a class in OOP+\n",
    "#    A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties \n",
    "#    (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "#    Think of a class as a blueprint for a house, and an object as an actual house built from that blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "#(3) What is an object in OOP+\n",
    "#    An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).\n",

    "#(4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation+\n",
    "#    Difference Between Abstraction and Encapsulation in OOP\n",
    "#    Both abstraction and encapsulation are fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented \n",
    "#    Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#       1. Abstraction (Hiding Implementation Details)\n",
    "#    Definition:         Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "#    Purpose:            Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "#    Example:            A car's steering wheel hides the complex mechanics of turning the wheels.\n",
    "#    Implementation:     Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#       2. Encapsulation (Data Hiding & Security)\n",
    "#    Definition:        Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some details.\n",
    "#    Purpose:           Protects data from direct modification and ensures controlled access.\n",
    "#    Example:           Bank account details are private and can only be accessed via specific methods.\n",
    "#    Implementation:    Achieved using private (__), protected (_), and public access modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (5) What are dunder methods in Python+\n",
    "#    Dunder methods (short for Double UNDERscore methods) are special built-in methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (__). \n",
    "#    These methods enable classes to have special behaviors like operator overloading, object representation, iteration, and more.\n",
    "#    They are also known as \"magic methods\" because Python calls them automatically in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    __init__(self, ...): This is the constructor method, called when an instance (object) of the class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    __str__(self): Defines the string representation of an object. This method is called by the built-in str() function and the print() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    __repr__(self): Defines the \"official\" string representation of an object. It is used by the repr() function and typically intended for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    __len__(self): This method is used to define the behavior of the len() function applied to an instance of your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    __getitem__(self, key): Allows access to the items of your class using the indexing syntax (obj[key]).\n",

    "\n",
    "#(6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
    "#    Inheritance is one of the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a child class (subclass)\n",
    "#    to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from a parent class (superclass).\n",
    "#    It helps in code reuse, reducing redundancy, and implementing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Code Reusability → Write code once and reuse it in multiple classes.\n",
    "#    Extensibility → Add new features without modifying existing code.\n",

    "#(7)  What is polymorphism in OOP+\n",
    "#    Polymorphism is a foundational concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes \n",
    "#    to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It lets you define a single interface for multiple underlying forms\n",
    "#    (data types). In simpler terms, polymorphism lets one interface interact with different data types and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#    There are two main types of polymorphism in OOP:\n",
    "#    Compile-time Polymorphism (or Static Polymorphism):\n",
    "#    Achieved through method overloading and operator overloading.\n",
    "#    Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter lists.\n",
    "#    Run-time Polymorphism (or Dynamic Polymorphism):\n",
    "#    Achieved through method overriding.\n",
    "#    Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#(8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python+\n",
    "#    Encapsulation is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to the \n",
    "#    data and methods inside a class. It helps in data hiding and ensures that internal class details are not exposed unnecessarily.\n",
    "#    Encapsulation is achieved by:\n",
    "#    Using access modifiers (public, protected, private).\n",
    "#    Using getter and setter methods to access or modify private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Modifier\t  Syntax\t  Access Level\n",
    "#   Public\t      variable\t  Accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "#   Protected\t _variable\t  Accessible within the class and subclasses.\n",
    "#   Private\t    __variable\t  Not accessible directly outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#(9)  What is a constructor in Python+\n",
    "#     A constructor is a special method that gets called automatically when an object of a class is created.\n",
    "#    It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "#    In Python, the constructor method is defined using __init__().\n",
    "\n",
    "#(10) What are class and static methods in Python+\n",
    "#     A class method works with the class itself rather than an instance (object). It is defined using the \n",

    "#     Can modify class variables.\n",
    "#     Defined using @classmethod.\n",
    "#     Takes cls (class reference) as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#     A static method is just like a regular function, but inside a class. It does not take self or cls as a parameter.\n",
    "#     It is used when we don't need access to instance attributes (self) or class variables (cls).\n",
    "\n",
    "#     Key Points:\n",

    "\n",
    "#(11) What is method overriding in OOP+\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Method Overloading allows multiple methods in a class to have the same name but different numbers or types of parameters.\n",
    "#    In Python, method overloading is NOT directly supported like in Java or C++, but we can achieve similar functionality\n",
    "#    using default arguments or *args and **kwargs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#(12)  What is a property decorator in Python+\n",
    "#     The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for class attributes in an elegant and readable way.\n",
    "#     It allows us to control access to private attributes while keeping the syntax simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "#     Encapsulation – Control access to private variables.\n",
    "#     Readability – Allows accessing methods like attributes (obj.value instead of obj.get_value()).\n",

    "\n",
    "#    Component\t                 Purpose\n",
    "#    @property\t                 Defines a getter method for an attribute.\n",

    "#      Readability – Allows calling methods as attributes (obj.value instead of obj.get_value()).\n",
    "#      Validation – Adds logic to check values before assigning them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#(14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP+\n",
    "#     Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows a single interface (method, function, or operator) to work with different types of objects.\n",
    "#     Key Idea: The same method name or operator can behave differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#     1. Importance of Polymorphism in OOP\n",
    "#     1. Improves Code Reusability\n",
    "#     You can use the same method name in different classes without rewriting code.\n",
    "#     Example: A draw() method can be used in multiple shape classes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle).\n",
    "#     2. Enhances Flexibility and Maintainability\n",
    "#     Makes it easier to modify and extend code without affecting existing functionality.\n",
    "#     Example: You can add a new shape (e.g., Polygon) without modifying existing code.\n",
    "#     3. Supports Method Overriding\n",
    "#     Allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
    "#     Example: A speak() method in a base class Animal, which is overridden in Dog and Cat classes.\n",
    "#     4. Enables Operator Overloading\n",
    "#     Allows operators like +, *, == to behave differently based on the object type.\n",
    "#     Example: \"Hello\" + \"World\" results in \"HelloWorld\", but 5 + 10 results in 15\n",
    "\n",
    "#(15) What is an abstract class in Python+\n",
    "#     An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated and must be inherited\n",
    "#     by subclasses that provide concrete implementations of its abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Key Features:\n",
    "#      Defined using ABC (Abstract Base Class) from the abc module.\n",
    "#      Contains abstract methods (methods without implementation).\n",
    "#      Cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "#      Forces subclasses to implement specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#(16)  What are the advantages of OOP+\n",
    "#      Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a popular paradigm \n",
    "#      or software development Here are some key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Modularity:\n",
    "#      OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces by creating objects\n",
    "#      (instances of classes). This modularity makes code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Reusability:\n",
    "#      With OOP, you can reuse existing classes and objects in new programs. This reduces redundancy and \n",
    "#      improves productivity by allowing you to leverage previously developed code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Inheritance:\n",
    "#      Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. It promotes code reusability and enables \n",
    "#      you to extend or modify the behavior of existing classes without rewriting them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Encapsulation:\n",
    "#      Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state and implementation details of an object. It provides a clear \n",
    "#      interface for interacting with the object while protecting its integrity. This leads to more secure and robust code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Polymorphism:\n",
    "#      Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables \n",
    "#      you to write more flexible and extensible code by defining methods that work with objects of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#       Abstraction:\n",
    "#      Abstraction simplifies complex systems by providing a high-level view and hiding unnecessary details. \n",
    "#      It allows you to focus on essential features and behavior while ignoring implementation specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Improved Collaboration:\n",
    "#      OOP promotes a clear structure and organization of code, making it easier for teams to collaborate on \n",
    "#      large projects. Each team member can work on different classes or modules without interfering with others' work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Scalability:\n",
    "#      OOP makes it easier to manage and scale large codebases. By organizing code into classes and objects,\n",

    "#     Definition: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within a class, but outside of any methods.\n",
    "#     Access: You can access class variables using the class name or an instance, but they are common to all instances.\n",
    "#     Purpose: They are used for attributes and properties that are shared by all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#      Instance Variables\n",
    "#      Definition: Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within the constructor (__init__ method\n",
